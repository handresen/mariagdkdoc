#  Geolocation

The Maria2012 Geolocation service allows fast, faceted freetext searches for partial or full placenames. General placename searches are supported, as well as street adress search.

A separate conversion step is required for converting from source data to a specialized [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) database. Converters exist for GNS and Geonames. For simple (ie csv based formats) writing new converters is relatively simple.
