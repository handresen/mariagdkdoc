summary: Perform bitmap export of a Maria layer stack. 
---

The export functionality of Maria GDK provides a way to get a bitmap export of a Maria layer stack. There are three different ways of achieving this depending on the level of control that is desired.
 <br/><br/>
 1.  [Simple Export](./core_maps_export_simple.html) for exporting the current layer stack. <br/>
 2.  [Offscreen Export](./core_maps_export_offscreen.html) for setting up layers to export off screen. <br/>
 3.  [Complex Export](./core_maps_export_complex.html) in addition to Offscreen Export this mode gives access to adding elements to the bitmap to export. <br/>

Each of these ways will be described in subsections of this wiki.
