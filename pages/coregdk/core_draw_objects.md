summary: The draw object module contains a full set of tactical graphics objects from the MIL-STD-2525C standard. In addition it contains a number of generic objects, such as line, area and ellipse, to mention a few. All the draw objects can have as many user defined data fields as desired.

Each draw object is of a specific type and has a hierarchy code that uniquely identifies that type. The hierarchy code matches the hierarchy value the object has in the MIL-STD-2525C standard. Generic objects also have a hierarchy code, which is defined by the Maria GDK and always starts with GENERIC.

The draw object module has a powerful mechanism for controlling the appearance of draw objects and its default data.
