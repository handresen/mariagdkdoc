## Available elevation data

Example:

* Dataset 1: Source resolution 10m
* Dataset 2:	Source resolution 0.5m
* Dataset 3: Source resolution 50m

## Oversampling: Profile sample distance is larger than data set resolution

When the sample distance is larger than the dataset resolution, peaks and dips between the samples may be lost when returning the sample point elevation only. Hence, additional information for the legs between the sample points is provided; Max, min and average elevation for the leg.

| Point | Elevation |
| ----  | ---- | 
| Start | 25 |
| 1 | 22 |
| 2	| 17 |
| 3	| 19 |
| End |	19 |

| Leg | Min | Max | Average |
| ----  | ---- | ----  | ---- | 
| Start â€“ 1 | 21 | 33 | 26
| 1-2 | 13 | 24 | 19 |
| 2-3 | 14 | 21 | 17 |
| 3-End | 19 | 28 | 22 |

## Undersampling: Profile sample distance is smaller than data set resolution

When the sample distance is smaller than the dataset resolution, with several samples within each cell, the profile will probably appear too flat within the cell and too steep between two cells. Different interpolation methods may be specified for smoothing the result.
