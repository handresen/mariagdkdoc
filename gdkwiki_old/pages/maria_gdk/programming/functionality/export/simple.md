## Simple Export

To use the simple export, the entry point is [MariaRasterExport](http://support.teleplanglobe.com/MariaGDKDoc/html/1919A26D.htm). This export is designed for maximum ease of use thus does not give many options for tweaking the output. It also means that a [MariaUserControl](http://support.teleplanglobe.com/MariaGDKDoc/html/5757FC60.htm) has to have been created already.

The export will have the same size as the layers are set up with.The dpi will also be regular screen dpi.
