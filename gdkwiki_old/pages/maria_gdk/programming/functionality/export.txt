====== Exporting Maria Layers ======
The export functionality of Maria 2012 GDK provides a way to get a bitmap export of a Maria layer stack. There are three different ways of achieving this depending on the level of control that is desired. 
  - [[maria_gdk:programming:functionality:export:simple|Simple Export]] for exporting the current layer stack.
  - [[maria_gdk:programming:functionality:export:offscreen|Offscreen Export]] for setting up layers to export off screen.
  - [[maria_gdk:programming:functionality:export:complex|Complex Export]] in addition to Offscreen Export this mode gives access to adding elements to the bitmap to export.
Each of these ways will be described in subsections of this wiki.
