| ECRG       | toc.xml    | This file format is potentially hard on memory requirements for our raster service. For this reason the default max scale ECRG datasets are visible on is set quite low.                                                                                                        |
| Tiff       | .tif       | If files have the projection defined in the file meta information, that projection will be used. If the projection information is not present you can supply it to the preparation pipeline, otherwise geographical coordinates will be assumed. Multiple files are supported.  |
| Jpeg 2000  |            | If files have the projection defined in the file meta information, that projection will be used. If the projection information is not present you can supply it to the preparation pipeline, otherwise geographical coordinates will be assumed. Multiple files are supported.  |
