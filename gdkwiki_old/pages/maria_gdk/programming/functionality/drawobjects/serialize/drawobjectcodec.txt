====== IDrawObjectCodec ======

Create an instance using **new DrawObjectCodec()**.

==== Reducing size of serialized data ====
If size of data is important, it is very important that all redundant attributes are reset before the objects are serialized. See [[maria_gdk:programming:functionality:drawobjects:serialize:bestpractises|Useful tips]] for more information.

==== Converting draw objects to protobuf ====
The [[maria_gdk:programming:functionality:drawobjects:serialize:serializedrawobjects|ISerializeDrawObjects]] interface is used to transfer from draw objects to protobuf. 

==== Converting protobuf to draw objects ====
The conversion supports data created both by [[maria_gdk:programming:functionality:drawobjects:serialize:serializedrawobjects|ISerializeDrawObjects]] and [[maria_gdk:programming:functionality:drawobjects:serialize:serializecompletedrawobjects|ISerializeCompleteDrawObjects]]. It is not necessary to check the origin of the byte[] data.
