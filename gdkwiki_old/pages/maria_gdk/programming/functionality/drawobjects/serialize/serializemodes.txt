====== SerializeModes ======
Controls how the SimpleDrawObject is serialized and can be used to reduce the size of the serialized data.	

=== FullPrecision ===
Default value. Complete data is serialized.

=== DoNotKeepInvalidFieldInformation ===
Information about invalid fields will not be transferred. This information might not be necessary to transfer if 100% resemblance is not required.

=== PointAsShiftedIntPrecision ===
Geographical points are transferred as shifted integer. This reduces the size of transferred data, but also reduces precision.

=== DoNotKeepSimpleDrawObjectId ===
The DrawObjectData's Id attribute will not be transferred. This information might not be necessary to transfer if the original Id is not required.
