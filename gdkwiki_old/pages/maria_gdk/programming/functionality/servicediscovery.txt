===== Service discovery =====
Many Maria GDK services can be set up to provide WCF UDP discovery. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Catalog service (IMapCatalogService)
  * Preparation service (IMariaMapPreparationService)
  * Track service (IMariaTrackService)
  * Draw object store service (IDrawObjectService)
  * Location/placename search service (ILocationService)

Discovery allows a service client to search for and connect to available service at runtime.
   
==== Service setup ====
Set "DiscoveryEnabled" to **true** in the settings.json service configuration file. Note that service discovery is disabled by default for all services.

Example:
<code javascript>
{
    "Version": "1.0",

    "GeneralSettings": {
        "InstallDir": "...",
        "ServicePort": "9008",
        "RegisterAs": "http://XXX:[port]",
        "LogPath": "%temp%\\Maria2012Log",
        "MaxLogFiles": "3",
        "MaxLogSize": "10MB"
    },
    "MapCatalogSettings": {
        "DiscoveryEnabled": true
    },
	 "TrackSettings": {
        "DiscoveryEnabled": true
    }
  // ...
}
</code>
==== Discovering services ====
Use the class [[http://support.teleplanglobe.com/mariagdkdoc/html/CB808DC3.htm|ServiceDiscoveryHelper]] to perform simple service discovery. 

<code csharp>
ServiceDiscoveryQuery sdq = new ServiceDiscoveryQuery();
sdq.Duration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
sdq.Interfaces.Add("IMapCatalogService");
sdq.Interfaces.Add("IMapTemplateService");

var discoveryHelper = new ServiceDiscoveryHelper();
var discovered = discoveryHelper.DiscoverServices(
  sdq, a=>Console.WriteLine(a.Address.AbsoluteUri+ " ver:"+a.Version));
</code>

=== Version filtering ===
Set ServiceDiscoveryQuery member [[http://support.teleplanglobe.com/mariagdkdoc/html/98B62DCB.htm|WantedVersion]] to filter the results based on reported version. The version is set based on the assembly version of the service implementation. By specifying only the most significant parts of the version, eg "3.1", all patch versions 3.1.x will be returned.

<code csharp>
sdq.WantedVersion="3.1";
</code>
