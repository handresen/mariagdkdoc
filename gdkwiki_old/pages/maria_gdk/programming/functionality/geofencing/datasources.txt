===== Data sources =====
Data sources are set up using the [[http://support.teleplanglobe.com/MariaGDKDoc/html/32457EC9.htm|IDataManagerServiceBase]] interface. 

Each data source entry causes the geo fencing service to fetch data from that source. One data source refers to a tracklist within a specified service or to a draw object list within a single draw object service.

Note that tracks and objects are fetched at preset intervals and are not synchronized to track updates or draw object updates. By using versioning/generations, only changed tracks or draw objects are fetched.

The geofencing service is responsible for handling cases where the data sources are temporarily unavailable, for instance if a source service is restarted.\\
