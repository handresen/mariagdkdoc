# Exporting Maria Layers

The export functionality of Maria 2012 GDK provides a way to get a bitmap export of a Maria layer stack. There are three different ways of achieving this depending on the level of control that is desired. 
 1.  [Simple Export](maria_gdk/programming/functionality/export/simple) for exporting the current layer stack.
 2.  [Offscreen Export](maria_gdk/programming/functionality/export/offscreen) for setting up layers to export off screen.
 3.  [Complex Export](maria_gdk/programming/functionality/export/complex) in addition to Offscreen Export this mode gives access to adding elements to the bitmap to export.
Each of these ways will be described in subsections of this wiki.
