====== Data Preparation ======
To demonstrate the Geo Fencing functionality, we need Tracks in a track service, and Geo Shapes (Draw objects) in a Draw Object service. We also need to move the tracks around, modify the draw objects, and to remove tracks and objects.
The following sections handles connecting to the services, and track/draw object management.
