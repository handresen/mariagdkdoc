====== Preprocess Vector Data ======
The Vector Map Service is contained in the Maria GDK and dedicated to produce maps from vector data. The Vector Map Service reads a proprietary Teleplan Globe map format (.m6mdata, .m6mindex), as well as vector tiles (.vtiles.sqlite). Both of these formats are created from sets of m6m files. An m6m file is equivalent to a single layer in a spatial dataset.

The m6m files may be produced using [[http://www.gdal.org/|Geospatial Data Abstraction Library / OGR]] or [[http://www.safe.com/fme/fme-desktop/|FME Desktop]]. Both require a writer / driver developed and distributed by Teleplan Globe to be able to produce m6m files.\\
