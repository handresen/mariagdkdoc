====== Raster map setup ======
Maria GDK raster map packages are used to setup and describe raster data. Although Maria GDK supports reading a large number of raster formats directly, the data should be converted to GeoPackage for optimal performance. Mappackages can be referenced from Maria GDK templates using the package mapsignature.
