====== Execution Engine ======
The execution engine takes a given script and executes it. The execution engine's main responsibilities are:
  * Executes each step in the script in sequence. Each step is executed in its own task making the service isolated from failures in steps.
  * Detect failures in single steps and make the errors available to the service API.
  * Make progress reported by each step available in an aggregated fashion.
