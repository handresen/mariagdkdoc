====== Uri Scheme for addin services ======

The addins really have a three part URI:
  * The base address consisting of hostname and port. This is defined by the hoster application, not by the individual addin.
  * First part of path after the base address. This is unique per addin. An example here for the track service with a hoster that defines a base address of <nowiki>http://localhost:9008</nowiki> would be <nowiki>http://localhost:9008/tracks.</nowiki>
  * Subsequent path elements can be used for additional endpoints that an addin exposes.

===== Conventions used for endpoints exposed by addins =====
==== First part of path ====
Exposes the default endpoint with a basic http endpoint, This part has to be unique per addin.
Example:
<code>
http://localhost:9008/tracks
</code>

==== Services that exposes a REST web interface ====
For addins that exposes web interfaces the second part of the path should be **web** and should be configured for automatic format selection:
Example:
<code>
http://localhost:9008/tracks/web
</code>
Configured with endpoint behavior:
<code xml>
<behavior name="RestBehaviorAuto">           
     <webHttp automaticFormatSelectionEnabled="True" />
</behavior>
</code>

If desired the service can also expose endpoints with specific return formats.
Examples:
<code>
http://localhost:9008/tracks/web/json
</code>
Configured with endpoint behavior:
<code xml>
<behavior name="RestBehaviorJSON">
   <webHttp defaultOutgoingResponseFormat="Json"/>
</behavior>
</code>

<code>
http://localhost:9008/tracks/web/xml
</code>
Configured with endpoint behavior:
<code xml>
<behavior name="RestBehaviorJSON">
   <webHttp defaultOutgoingResponseFormat="Xml"/>
</behavior>
</code>

==== Services with multiple basic http endpoints ====
Services that exposes multiple basic http endpoints should expose the most used at the root path described in [[urischeme#first_part_of_path|First part of path]] then use subsequent path elements for hosting other endpoints. The same scheme [[urischeme#services_that_exposes_a_rest_web_interface|described]] before should be used for REST versions of these basic http endpoints.
Example from the geo fencing service:
<code>
http://localhost:9008/geofencing/rules
http://localhost:9008/geofencing/notifications

http://localhost:9008/geofencing/web/rules
http://localhost:9008/geofencing/web/notifications

http://localhost:9008/geofencing/web/json/rules
http://localhost:9008/geofencing/web/json/notifications

http://localhost:9008/geofencing/web/xml/rules
http://localhost:9008/geofencing/web/xml/notifications
</code>
