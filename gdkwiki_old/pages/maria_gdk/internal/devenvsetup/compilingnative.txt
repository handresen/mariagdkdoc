====== Compiling native code using Visual Studio 2010 ======
Compiling the native/mixedmode code of Maria2012 requires the native compiler included in Visual Studio 2010. Due to potential problems when installing multiple versions of Visual Studio on the same Windows 8.0/8.1 system, one option is to install VS2010 on a virtual machine.

  * [[maria_gdk:internal:devenvsetup:hyperv|Install OS on HyperV]]
  * Install VS 2010 on VM from \\tpg-file\ISO\MSDN download\Developer Tools. Use custom install, only include "Visual C++" and "Visual C#". C++/Itanium can be disabled
  * Install SP1 from [[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691]]
  * Install 2010 hotfix for building mixed mode: [[\\tpg-file\Project\50 GLO\95031-S-MARIA\F) Annet\VS2010 Hotfix\VS10SP1-KB2566268-x86.exe]]
  * Start Visual Studio 2010
