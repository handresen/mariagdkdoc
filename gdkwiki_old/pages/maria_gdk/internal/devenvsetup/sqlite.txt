===== Working with sqlite databases in VS =====

[[http://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki|System.Data.SQLite]] is a ADO.net adapter for SQLite and makes it possible to view and edit sqlite databases from Visual Studio. Make sure to download the correct version of the adapter for your version of Visual Studio.

F.ex for Visual Studio 2013 choose:
<WRAP center round box 100%>
**Setups for 32-bit Windows (.NET Framework 4.5.1)**\\
sqlite-netFx451-setup-bundle-x86-2013-1.0.94.0.exe (10.02 MiB) \\

This setup package features the mixed-mode assembly and will install all the necessary runtime components and dependencies for the x86 version of the System.Data.SQLite 1.0.94.0 (3.8.6) package. The Visual C++ 2013 Update 2 runtime for x86 is included. The .NET Framework 4.5.1 is required. \\
**This is the only setup package that is capable of installing the design-time components for Visual Studio 2013.**

After installing System.Data.SQLite you can open sqlite databases via View->Server Explorer in Visual Studio. Right clik on Data Connections and add a database using "Add connection". The database will then be available for navigating, queries, editing etc.
