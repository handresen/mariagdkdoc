======  Location Service ======

The Location Service can perform searches in database files containing point of interests. Typical usage is search in place name and address databases. 

In the application configuration the **Location files root path** should point to the folder containing the location files, by default set to //C:\ServiceTest\LocationTextFiles\// **Folder recursion depth** indicates how many folders down from the root folder the service will search for location files.

The default **Service port** is set to 9005
