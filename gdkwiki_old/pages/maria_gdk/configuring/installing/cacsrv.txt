======  Map Cache Service ======
The Map Cache Service builds a cache of map tiles for quicker retrieval of data and higher performance.

In the application configuration there is an option to change the **Cache root path** where the cache files are stored. In the cache root path there will be one subfolder for each template in the Map Catalog Service.

**discUsageThreshold** is only accesible from the config file. This parameter indicates the percentage of the harddrive the Cache Service is allowed to use.

By default the **Service port** is set to 9007.
