======  Raster Map Service ======

The Raster Map Service is dedicated to produce maps from raster data. 

In the installation configuration, **Map root path** should be set to the folder containing the map files or a [[maria_gdk:maps:config:links|links.xml]] file to redirect the service to another folder. **Map recursion depth** indicates how many folders down from the main map folder the service will search for maps. **No. of Instances to Run** indicates how many instances of the Raster Map Service will run simultaneously.

**maxMemorySize** and **multiThread** are only accesible from the config file. These parameters indicate the maximum number of bytes of memory to be used, and whether the service will utilize multithreading, respectively.

If several instances of the service are run, each instance will pick the first available port in the **Service Port Range**. By default the **Service port range** is set to 9050-9099.
