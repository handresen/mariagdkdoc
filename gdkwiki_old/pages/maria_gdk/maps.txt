===== Vector Maps =====
The Vector Map Service is contained in the Maria GDK and dedicated to serve maps from vector data. The Vector Map Service reads the open standard format [[https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec|Vector Tiles]]. These files are produced using [[http://www.gdal.org/|Geospatial Data Abstraction Library / OGR]] or [[http://www.safe.com/fme/fme-desktop/|FME Desktop]], and a proprietary tool. [[.:maps:config:mariamapmaker|Maria Map Maker]] contains all the neccessary components for producing and styling vector maps. 


===== Raster Maps =====
The Raster Map Service is contained in the Maria GDK and dedicated to serve maps from raster data. The Raster Map Service contains dedicated readers for the following formats:
  * Geopackage
  * MBTiles
  * ECW
  * QM2

In addition, the Raster Map Service uses [[http://www.gdal.org/|Geospatial Data Abstraction Library]] to read a wide variety of other raster formats. The Raster Service is controlled by a set of configuration files that defines the composition of each dataset. The Raster service produces data for visual maps, elevation analysis, and effect layers.\\
